```

```
combineReducers({
  ...yourExistingReducers,
  ToastReducer,
})
```

Add `ToastContainer` with optional children.

import { ToastContainer } from 'react-toast-component'
```

```
<ToastContainer />
```

```
<ToastContainer>
  <h1>Your custom elements can go in here.</h1>
</ToastContainer>
```

`toastActions.js` : Dispatch actions to update toast properties.

```
import { ToastActions } from 'react-toast-component'
```

```
toastActions.showToast({
  title: 'Added',
  description: 'Your item was added.',
  duration: '5000',
});
```
